# ðŸªŸ Zebar + GlazeWM Configs  
Minimal and clean setup themed with the [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com) color palette.

## ðŸ§  Overview

This repository contains my personal configuration files for:

- [GlazeWM](https://github.com/glzr-io/glazewm) â€” a tiling window manager for Windows.
- [Zebar](https://github.com/glzr-io/zebar) â€” a minimal status bar designed to integrate seamlessly with GlazeWM.

The design focuses on readability, soft colors, and clean layout â€” powered by **Catppuccin Mocha**.
